[mod-setting-description]
ret-enable-connect-particles=If enabled, red and green particles will show if rails become powered or unpowered.
ret-enable-failure-text=If enabled, a message text will pop up if two overhead line poles could not be connected.
ret-enable-modular-info=If enabled, a message text will pop up whenever the module configuration of a modular locomotive is changed.
ret-enable-zigzag-wire=If enabled, the wire will be moved left and right on straight rails to mimic the zigzag pattern that overhead lines in real life use. This has no ingame effect other than aesthetics. Does not affect existing wires.
ret-enable-zigzag-vertical-only=Only enable the zigzag wire for vertical rails. This is useful, as the wires in Factorio normally "hang" a bit, which makes zigzag lines on horizontal or diagonal rails useless. Does not affect existing wires.
ret-remove-wires-on-build=If enabled, overhead poles will only connect to other overhead poles when placed and not to other entities. To connect them to other electric poles, those need to be placed afterwards.
ret-enable-circuit-wire=If enabled, red and green circuit wires are automatically installed between adjacent poles. Can be used to compensate for the fact that blueprinted circuit wires are unfortunately not retained. Does not affect existing poles.
ret-enable-rewire-neighbours=If enabled, neighbours of newly placed poles will be rewired. This fixes some weird wiring patterns, but takes more processing time. Does not affect existing poles.
ret-max-pole-search-distance=The additional distance checked when searching for overhead line poles. A higher value gives more accurate distances in the failure message. A lower value might increase performance during building.
ret-ticks-per-update=Defines how many ticks need to pass until the next train update is run. Higher values obviously improve performance, while lower values ensure that the trains are powered more consistently. The default is 60 Ticks (1 second).
